Ape tasks
#######################################

A task is comparable with a django management command but is aware of
your *djpl* setup and supports refinements.

Tasks are defined by features. There are two types of tasks:

1) Tasks that do not require to be zapped into a product
2) Tasks that do required to be zapped into a product

============================================

So, let's start by activating ape and invoking ``help``::

    cd ~/Desktop/code/webapps
    . _ape/activape
    ape help
    
For now we are not zapped into a product. So we see a list of basic tasks.
The following list gives an overview of the most relevant ape tasks which are not product-aware:

* ``ape help``
* ``ape zap <container>:<product>``
