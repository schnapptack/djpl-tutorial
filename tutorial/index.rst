Welcome to the tutorial for django-productline. Django-produtline is a python package turning django 
into a feature-oriented framework for web application productlines. This tutorial teaches how to setup and maintain
django-productline projects and conveys the basics of *feature oriented software development* (FOSD) in Python.

*django productline* does not affect the way of how to develop django applications but the
methotodology of organizing existing functionality for better reuse. django-productline radically
reduces the amount of glue code and emphazises reuse.
